# Privacy Policy

Privacy policy is very simple: this extension does not share your data or transmit it to any external sources. I really don't care what sites you go on, and storing/sharing your data would require more code, which is more work for me.
The only data processed is the URL of the window that's active at the time of you clicking on the extension to activate it. It is saved as a Javascript variable to be inserted on the new Cobalt tab that's created, and then never used again. No data will ever be transmitted to myself, or any other parties from your device.
